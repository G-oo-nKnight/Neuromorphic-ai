# 🚀 GitHub as Primary Source - Setup Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

### 📁 Repository Structure
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/G-oo-nKnight/Neuromorphic-ai
- **Main Branch**: `main` (protected, single source of truth)
- **All code synced and ready**

### 📋 Templates & Guidelines
1. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Complete development workflow
2. **Pull Request Template** - With neural impact checklist
3. **Issue Templates**:
   - Bug reports with neural state tracking
   - Feature requests with biological inspiration

### 🛠️ Development Tools
1. **Sync Script**: `scripts/sync-from-github.sh`
   ```bash
   npm run git:sync  # Syncs your local with GitHub
   ```

2. **Git Scripts in package.json**:
   ```bash
   npm run git:status    # Check status
   npm run git:pull      # Pull latest from main
   npm run git:push      # Push to main
   npm run git:branch feature/name  # Create feature branch
   npm run git:commit "message"     # Stage and commit
   npm run git:log       # View recent commits
   ```

## 🔄 Workflow for Updates

### For Contributors:
1. **Always start by syncing**:
   ```bash
   npm run git:sync
   ```

2. **Create feature branch**:
   ```bash
   npm run git:branch feature/your-feature
   ```

3. **Make changes and test**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run dev  # or pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs
   ```

4. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   npm run git:commit "feat: Add visual cortex processing"
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

5. **Create Pull Request on GitHub**

### For Maintainers:
1. **Review PRs on GitHub**
2. **Merge to main branch**
3. **Automatic deployment (if CI/CD configured)**

## 📊 GitHub Features to Use

## 🔐 GitHub Actions (Manual Setup Required)

Due to permissions, add the workflow manually:
1. Go to https://github.com/G-oo-nKnight/Neuromorphic-ai/actions
2. Click "set up a workflow yourself"
3. Copy content from `github-workflow-deploy.yml.example`
4. Save as `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
5. Add secrets in Settings > Secrets:
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`

## 📈 Best Practices

### Commit Messages
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation
- `perf:` Performance improvements
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions

### Branch Naming
- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation
- `refactor/` for code improvements

### Code Review
- All changes through PRs
- At least one review before merge
- Run tests before approving
- Check neural accuracy

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Star the repository** ⭐
2. **Watch for updates** 👁️
3. **Fork for experiments** 🍴
4. **Create issues for bugs/features** 🐛
5. **Submit PRs for improvements** 🚀

## 📚 Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Daily workflow
npm run git:sync          # Start your day
npm run git:branch fix/bug-name  # Create branch
npm run build             # Build project
npm run dev               # Test locally
npm run git:commit "fix: message"  # Commit
git push origin fix/bug-name      # Push branch

# Maintenance
npm run git:status        # Check status
npm run git:log           # View history
npm run git:pull          # Get latest

# Deployment (after merge to main)
npm run deploy            # Deploy to Cloudflare
```

## 🧠 Remember

> **GitHub is now the single source of truth for the Enhanced Neuromorphic AI project!**

All development, issues, discussions, and deployments flow through GitHub.
